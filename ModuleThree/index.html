   					<h2>HISTORY</h2>
    				<p>The history of the cat is an interesting tale with twists and turns at every few hundred years. The cat has been worshiped, adored, loathed, and persecuted by humans throughout time. To understand cats' place in today's society, it is important to know how the relationship between cats and humans began. 
    				<br><br>
    				It has been 5000 years since man domesticated the cat. The first cat made tame was the African Wildcat. The cat wasn't domesticated to make a pet or companion; the cat was domesticated by accident. 
    				<br><br>
    				In the Valley of the Nile (which is now Sudan, but then was Upper Egypt), the cat was first domesticated. The people in Egypt at that time consumed large amounts of grain, and they stored this grain in large storage rooms. Many rats would draw to these rooms to eat the grain and breed. The rats attracted cats who would eat the rats, thus helping to eliminate Egypt's rodent problem. People recognized this fact and left food out for the cats to encourage them to "hang around." It worked. Many cats bred and lived happy lives in Egypt destroying the plentiful rats. 
    				<br><br>
    				Now the Pharaoh had much grain that needed protection from vermin. He wanted to confiscate all of the cats in Egypt and keep them near the palace granaries, but he couldn't. Cats were so popular among his people that to remove all the cats from all the people in Egypt would have caused a revolt. So, instead he cleverly declared all cats "demigods." This means that they weren't gods equal to the Pharaoh's status, but they certainly were more valuable than the average person. With this plan, people could care for the demigods (cats) while they remained the official property of the Pharaoh. The status of the cat shot up overnight. If anyone killed a cat, they were sentenced to death. If a house caught on fire, the cats were pulled to safety first. If a cat died of natural causes, the family had to bring the dead animal to the priest to make certain the cat's death was natural. People would sob for their cat with outwardly displays of sorrow. Shaving their eyebrows or beating their chest was a good sign of this sadness.
                    <br><br>
                    In time, the cat became known for health, fortune, and marriage. To have many cats meant you were very lucky.
                    <br><br>
                    At first the People thought that cats and dogs were the bringers of plague. This led to the annihilation of both animals. Later it was discovered that there was less of a problem with plague if there was a lot of cats around. This encouraged people to start keeping cats again.

                    <h2>How to Take Care of Your Cat's Basic Needs</h2>
                    <ol>

                        <li>Choose a good quality dry cat food. Cheap brands often don't contain the essential nutrients cats and kittens need to grow remain healthy.
                        <li>Cats need fresh water all the time and can get dehydrated easily. Make sure to provide a fresh bowl of water everyday.
                        <li>If cats don't have a scratching post they might resort to your sofa! If you don't want to buy one, try using a cardboard box.
                        <li>Sometimes, cats won't eat if they can see the bottom of their bowls!
                        <li>If you have an indoor dog it will be interested in your cats litter box! Make sure it is in a place where it would be out of the reach of babies, young children, and other animals like dogs.

    				<h2>FACTS</h2>
    				<ol>
    					<li>A cat lover is called an Ailurophilia (Greek: cat+lover)
    					<li>A cat usually has about 12 whiskers on each side of its face.
    					<li>A cat’s nose pad is ridged with a unique pattern, just like the fingerprint of a human.
    					<li>A group of kittens is called a "kindle." A group of grown cats is called a "clowder." A male cat is called a "tom," a female cat is called a "molly" or "queen", and young cats are called "kittens."
    					<li>According to Hebrew legend, Noah prayed to God for help protecting all the food he stored on the ark from being eaten by rats. In reply, God made the lion sneeze, and out popped a cat.
    					<li>A cat has 230 bones in its body. A human has 206. A cat has no collarbone, so it can fit through any opening the size of its head. Cats use their whiskers to find out if a space is too small to squeeze into. 
    					<li>The reason for the lack of mouse-flavored cat food is due to the fact that the test subjects (cats, naturally!) did not like it.
    					<li>Cats make about 100 different sounds. Dogs make only about 10.
    					<li>A cat cannot see directly under its nose. This is why the cat cannot seem to find tidbits on the floor.
                        <li>The first cat in space was a French cat named Felicette (a.k.a. “Astrocat”) In 1963, France blasted the cat into outer space. Electrodes implanted in her brains sent neurological signals back to Earth. She survived the trip.
                        <li>According to Hebrew legend, Noah prayed to God for help protecting all the food he stored on the ark from being eaten by rats. In reply, God made the lion sneeze, and out popped a cat.
                        <li>A cat’s hearing is better than a dog’s. And a cat can hear high-frequency sounds up to two octaves higher than a human.
                        <li>When a family cat died in ancient Egypt, family members would mourn by shaving off their eyebrows. They also held elaborate funerals during which they drank wine and beat their breasts. The cat was embalmed with a sculpted wooden mask and the tiny mummy was placed in the family tomb or in a pet cemetery with tiny mummies of mice.
                        <li>Foods that should not be given to cats include onions, garlic, green tomatoes, raw potatoes, chocolate, grapes, and raisins. Though milk is not toxic, it can cause an upset stomach and gas. Tylenol and aspirin are extremely toxic to cats, as are many common houseplants. Feeding cats dog food or canned tuna that's for human consumption can cause malnutrition.
                        <li>The oldest cat on record was Crème Puff from Austin, Texas, who lived from 1967 to August 6, 2005, three days after her 38th birthday. A cat typically can live up to 20 years, which is equivalent to about 96 human years.
                        <li>One reason that kittens sleep so much is because a growth hormone is released only during sleep.
                        <li>The majority of cats do not have any eyelashes
                        <li>If your cat is thrashing its tail, she is in a bad mood - time for you to keep your distance!
                        <li>In Japan, cats are thought to have the power to turn into super spirits when they die. This may be because according to the Buddhist religion, the body of the cat is the temporary resting place of very spiritual people.
                        <li>If your cat is near you, and her tail is quivering, this is the greatest expression of love your cat can give you.
